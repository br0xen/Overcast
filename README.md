Overcast
========

Get a quick overview of all of your netcasts!

This application was made to fulfill a request of a netcast wrangler. It is purely informational, it is not for downloading netcasts/podcasts and listening to them. It's just for inputing your feed URLs and being able to quickly see:

The title of the most recent item in the feed
The Publish Date of the most recent item in the feed
The Filename for the most recent item in the feed.

That's it, enjoy. If you have any questions or problems, feel free to let me know. I rushed this from start to finish and everything works fine on my Nexus S, so I hope it works for you too!

This app is no longer available on the Google Play store because overcast.fm put a trademark infringement claim on it, even though their app is iOS only, and came out 2 years later.
